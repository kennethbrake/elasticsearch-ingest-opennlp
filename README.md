# Elasticsearch OpenNLP Ingest Processor

I wrote a [opennlp mapping plugin](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin) a couple of years ago and people asked me, why I did not update it. The main reason was, that it was a bad architectural choice as mentioned in the [openlp plugin README](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin#elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin). With the introduction of ingest processors in Elasticsearch 5.0 this problem has been resolved.

This processor is doing named/date/location entity recognition and stores the output in the JSON before it is being stored.

This plugin is also intended to show you, that using gradle as a build system makes it very easy to reuse the testing facilities that elasticsearch already provides. First, you can run regular tests, but by adding a rest test, the plugin will be packaged and unzipped against elasticsearch, allowing you to execute a real end-to-end test, by just adding a java test class.

## Usage

This is how you configure a pipeline with support for opennlp

```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/opennlp-pipeline
{
  "description": "A pipeline to do named entity extraction",
  "processors": [
    {
      "opennlp" : {
        "field" : "my_field"
      }
    }
  ]
}

PUT /my-index/my-type/1?pipeline=opennlp-pipeline
{
  "my_field" : "Kobe Bryant was one of the best basketball players of all times. Not even Michael Jordan has ever scored 81 points in one game. Munich is really an awesome city, but New York is as well. Yesterday has been the hottest day of the year."
}

GET /my-index/my-type/1
{
  "my_field" : "Kobe Bryant was one of the best basketball players of all times. Not even Michael Jordan has ever scored 81 points in one game. Munich is really an awesome city, but New York is as well. Yesterday has been the hottest day of the year.",
  "entities" : {
    "locations" : [ "Munich", "New York" ],
    "dates" : [ "Yesterday" ],
    "names" : [ "Kobe Bryant", "Michael Jordan" ]
  }
}
```

You can also specify only certain named entities in the processor, i.e. if you only want to extract names


```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/opennlp-pipeline
{
  "description": "A pipeline to do named entity extraction",
  "processors": [
    {
      "opennlp" : {
        "field" : "my_field"
        "fields" : [ "names" ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Valid values are `names`, `dates` and `locations`.

## Configuration

There are only three settings, which configure the path of the models being used (note that those need to be in the `config/` to be readable due to the Java Security Manager.

| Parameter | Use |
| --- | --- |
| ingest.opennlp.model.file.name     | Configure the file for named entity recognition    |
| ingest.opennlp.model.file.location | Configure the file for location entity recognition |
| ingest.opennlp.model.file.date     | Configure the file for date entity recognition     |

## Setup

In order to install this plugin, you need to create a zip distribution first by running

```bash
gradle clean check
```

This will produce a zip file in `build/distributions`. As part of the build, the models are packaged into the zip file, but need to be downloaded before. There is a special task in the `build.gradle` which is downloading the models, in case they dont exist.

After building the zip file, you can install it like this

```bash
bin/plugin install file:///path/to/elasticsearch-ingest-opennlp/build/distribution/ingest-opennlp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

There is no need to configure anything, as the models art part of the zip file.

## Bugs & TODO

* A couple of groovy build mechanisms from core are disabled. See the `build.gradle` for further explanations
* Only the most basic NLP functions are exposed, please fork and add your own code to this!
